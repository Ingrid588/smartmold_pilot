# SmartMold Pilot — Test Report (2026-01-14)

## Scope
This report captures the **offline/deterministic automated tests** that can be run without external API credentials.

## Environment
- OS: macOS
- Workspace: `SmartMold_Pilot`

## Test Run
- Command: `./scripts/run_test_suite.sh`
- Result: **PASS**
- Run timestamp (local): 2026-01-14

## Executed Tests & Results
| ID | Test | How it runs | Result | Notes |
|---:|------|-------------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Syntax check | `python -m py_compile` over key modules | PASS | Guards against syntax regressions |
| 2 | AI-notes → PDF smoke test | `python smoke_test_ai_to_pdf.py` | PASS | Confirms stored realtime AI notes render into PDF **without live AI calls** |
| 3 | Full seeded PDF report generation | `python test_pdf_report.py` | PASS | Generates a complete Brand1 validation report with Steps 1–7 |

## Produced Artifacts
- `static/Brand1_Report_20260114_154751.pdf`
  - Generated by smoke test
  - Includes section: **Realtime AI Notes**
- `Brand1_Report_Complete_Test.pdf`
  - Generated by full report generator
  - Contains Steps 1–7 data blocks (seeded)

## Key Behaviors Verified
- PDF generation does **not** call realtime AI during export; it embeds **stored** AI notes captured during the workflow.
- PDF rendering is robust against common FPDF layout errors (e.g., multi-cell width issues).

## Known Limitations / Not Covered (By Design)
- **Live provider integration** (OpenAI/Gemini/etc.) is not exercised by this deterministic suite because it requires:
  - Valid API keys
  - Network access
  - Provider availability/rate limits
- Optional dependency checks:
  - `weasyprint` may be missing in local environments; related HTML→PDF tests (if any) are expected to be skipped/fail gracefully when not installed.

## Recommendations for Release / UAT
If you want an end-to-end validation with real AI providers:
1. Configure API keys in the Settings page.
2. Run the realtime AI step(s) in the Scientific Molding workflow (Step 0–7 as applicable).
3. Export the final PDF and confirm the “Realtime AI Notes” section contains the captured notes.
